MonsterWars8-Composition-Framework
==================================

Framework version of the Cocos2d Component based architecture from Raywenderlich.com
http://www.raywenderlich.com/24878/introduction-to-component-based-architecture-in-games

Since the Component Based architecture done by Ray Wenderlich was really nice, I decided to turn this into a framework.

To understanda on how to use this framework, please read the link above.

To get to the framework, clone this git and add the Products/EntitySystem.framework to your project.
